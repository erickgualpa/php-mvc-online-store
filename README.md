# PHP MVC Online Store :credit_card: :money_with_wings:
### :small_orange_diamond: What is this about?
This project was made in my 3rd year of college and was the main work from the web development subject. 
The point of this repository is not show a complex website (from an online store) nor try to develop anything 
similar to what you could reach with any of the current main frameworks. This only tries to reflect at its 
maximum the distinction between all the parts from the MVC pattern. 

The front-end side is made with pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the back-end side is essentially PHP. 
Having account that this was a project from college, is easy to find the main concepts of web-developement applied such as: 
 - Cookies
 - Session 
 - AJAX
 - Responsive view 
 - CRUD actions against a MySQL database using prepared statements  

### :small_orange_diamond: Interesting facts
The theme from the online store project was free choice. In my case, if you do a little research through the files 
you'll find out that I chose making a boxing material store. 

Even though taking the risk of not being original, I named it Ali Boxing Store in honour to the GOAT.

### :small_orange_diamond: Considerations
This repository include some images that are not free to use in a real project. Just as I said, this was a college 
project and consequentlly a non-profit project. So, I would like to give the corresponding credits to the owners of 
the images and the thanks to help complete this work.
